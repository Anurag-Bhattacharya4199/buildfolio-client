My BuildPortfolio Web Application:
---
In the Buildfolio Web Application, a student, new graduate or new professional can automate the creation of their Portfolio Website through a series of forms. Users will input basic information about themselves and then will add specific details from a dashboard like education history, work history, projects, skills and references. Using all this information, a template Portfolio Web Page with multiple informative tabs will be available for users to view and share.
